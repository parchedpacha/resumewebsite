So in no particular order, here are some of the things that I've done that I think are worth mentioning.
1. Ran a First Robotics Team and got to the World Championships

One of my most proud accomplishments is getting to the world championships, and I can't thank the wonderful mentors that joined me enough! Every success and failure was shared and being here at this time and place has truly been a blessing.


2. Launched my father out of a rocket

My Father passed away in 2018. in 2019, with permission of the rocketry team that I was a part of, OSU Hybrid Rocketry, I put a small amount of his ashes into our rocket next to the parachute deployment charge. Here's the video we put together of our launch:

We also put his ashes into several other places that he would have really enjoyed. The First was Cascade Head, a wonderful natural area on the Oregon coast, near Salmon River. My brother Damon spread some in Colorado in an peacefull stream tucked between some 14k ft peaks. The last several palces were all in Hawaii. We spread some in the water off of Kona in two separate places, a beach that he loved, and a crazy rock outcropping that had a pool that filled and emptied on every wave, it filled up 6 to 10 feet, it was a great sunset. We also put his ashes into a jungle that we hiked through, and we spread some at the top of the Big Island, near the telescopes. its incredibly cold up there but so worth the view!


Here's Cascade Head:

3. Launched the Brightdrop Electric Delivery Van

I made sure that the suspension and chassis components of the van assembled properly, and quickly. On the launch day, I saw Prime Minister Trudeau give a speech in both english and french.
