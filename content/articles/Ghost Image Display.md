This display uses a string of LEDs (WS2812b, if you want to buy some on amazon), connected to an arduino and SD card. 
The arduino reads images from the SD card, and displays them one column at a time to make this ghostly display. 
Any image sized corectly will do! 

Here is a couple more pictures of this display!
