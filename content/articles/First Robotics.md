For the last two years, I have been a mentor for First Robotics Team 5901. This year, we advanced far enough to get to the Michigan State Championship as well as the World Championship in Houston, TX. We had a hectic time organizing it last minute but I wouldn't trade that time for anything. My team performed at their peak, placing well above expectations and predictions. Watching my students put all of their mechanical work, practice, and skill into every match was great to see. First Robotics is a large time commitment, with an even larger commitment for Lead Mentor. Its been quite a few late nights since the season started on Jan 7th, every single one was well worth it!


Ever since I stopped being taught I've been teaching in one form or another. Its how I give back to the world a little bit. First Robotics is a great fit for me, and a wonderful opportunity for students to learn about technical concepts, put in hard rewarding work and gain confidence in their ability to tackle big problems.  If you have any technical, media, or just people skills, you'd also make a great mentor. Each year is a different challenge that has students go from problem to real world solution rapidly. This year’s challenge was “Charged Up”, [here\'s a video on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zpflsYc4PA).
