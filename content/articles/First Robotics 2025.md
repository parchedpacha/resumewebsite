For the past 10 weeks I have mentored FIRST Robotics Team 6566 "Battering Rams" out of Lamphere High School in Madison Heights, MI. 

FIRST is an after school program that uses robots to teach STEM topics to high school students, and prepare them for work in a team based environment. Engineering concepts like gear ratios, power/energy/velocity/acceleration relationships, torque, Object Oriented Programming, systems engineering 3d modeling, and most importantly: Teamwork! 

Just yesterday the team made it to 2nd place in the district championship held in Belleville, MI. Congratulations to the team! Here are a couple photos from the event.
