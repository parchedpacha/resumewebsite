On April 12th I launched my "Fanton 438 (EXL)" kit. This is a 64 inch tall, 4 inch diameter rocket. Here is the video, with a breakdown below:

Why did the rocket fail? Looking at the video closely, you can see that the rocket deployed the main chhute on the way up, leading to a complete separation of the upper and lower stage. I used a motor deployment system for my parachute, and this system requires delay to be set using a drilling tool. I properly calibrated this tool according to the instructions and consulted multiple experts to confirm that I had the motor configured correctly. While it is still a possibility that I set this up wrong, a conversation with the events motor sell revealed that he had sold 5 motors from the same manufacturer (Aerotech), of the same model number (H100W-14A), that were manufactured the day before this one. 3 of those 5 motors exhibited similar behavior. 

While this is an unfortunate setback, there are some upsides! Only the lower stage was damaged, along with a small rip in the parachute. Therefore, I am only out the cost of a new base model version of this kit. With shipping, thats $150. All my electronics survived just fined and are fully reusable. I will contact the motor manufacturer and get a replacement motor, hopefully under warranty.
