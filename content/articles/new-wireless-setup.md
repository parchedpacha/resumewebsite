Title: "Plans for new wireless setup"

I plan to use this [guide](https://www.tekovic.com/blog/openwrt-80211s-mesh-networking/) and this youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofR7GFNZzJY) to put together a long range wireless network for use in low cell service areas, as my new home will be somewhat far away from good service, accessible only via starlink internet. I'll update this page when I get time to investigate this further.
