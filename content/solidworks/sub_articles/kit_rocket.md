Short version: I modeled this assembly in order to test fit a battery retainer that I had a friend 3D print. 

This assembly models the electronics bay of my kit rocket, and is used in conjunction with my arduino uno telemetry receiver, and my MATLAB telemetry script, in order to for a fully functional rocket tracking and landing site prediction suite. I  used this system  May 31st 2025 to launch and recover intact my level 1 certification rocket as part of the Tripoli Rocketry association. I used the mockup shown below to  connect to the rocket system and successfully tracked my rocket from launch to  landing.
